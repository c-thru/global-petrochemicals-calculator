This work presents a comparative technoeconomic and environmental analysis of producing aromatics from methanol and naphtha. First, the processes of producing aromatics from methanol and naphtha are modeled in the Aspen HYSYS simulator to obtain detailed mass and energy balances. On this basis, the technoeconomic and life cycle analyses are conducted. The comparative results indicate that the net present value of producing aromatics from methanol is significantly higher than producing aromatics from naphtha. Moreover, the total capital investment of the former is lower than the latter. In terms of the ten studied impact categories, methanol derived from natural gas leads to the least freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity potential, while that derived from biomass shows the lowest abiotic depletion potential, global warming potential, ozone layer depletion potential, and photochemical ozone creation potential. However, naphtha does the best performance regarding the rest five impact categories.},

   title = {Comparative assessment of blue hydrogen from steam methane reforming, autothermal reforming, and natural gas decomposition technologies for natural gas-producing regions},
   journal = {Energy Conversion and Management},
   volume = {254},
   pages = {115245},
   abstract = {Interest in blue hydrogen production technologies is growing. Some researchers have evaluated the environmental and/or economic feasibility of producing blue hydrogen, but a holistic assessment is still needed. Many aspects of hydrogen production have not been investigated. There is very limited information in the literature on the impact of plant size on production and the extent of carbon capture on the cost and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of blue hydrogen production through various production pathways. Detailed uncertainty and sensitivity analyses have not been included in most of the earlier studies. This study conducts a holistic comparative cost and life cycle GHG emissions’ footprint assessment of three natural gas-based blue hydrogen production technologies – steam methane reforming (SMR), autothermal reforming (ATR), and natural gas decomposition (NGD) to address these research gaps. A hydrogen production plant capacity of 607 tonnes per day was considered. For SMR, based on the percentage of carbon capture and capture points, we considered two scenarios, SMR-52% (indicates 52% carbon capture) and SMR-85% (indicates 85% carbon capture). A scale factor was developed for each technology to understand the hydrogen production cost with a change in production plant size. Hydrogen cost is 1.22, 1.23, 2.12, 1.69, 2.36, 1.66, and 2.55 $/kg H2 for SMR, ATR, NGD, SMR-52%, SMR-85%, ATR with carbon capture and sequestration (ATR-CCS), and NGD with carbon capture and sequestration (NGD-CCS), respectively. The results indicate that when uncertainty is considered, SMR-52% and ATR are economically preferable to NGD and SMR-85%. SMR-52% could outperform ATR-CCS when the natural gas price decreases and the rate of return increases. SMR-85% is the least attractive pathway; however, it could outperform NGD economically when CO2 transportation cost and natural gas price decrease. Hydrogen storage cost significantly impacts the hydrogen production cost. SMR-52%, SMR-85%, ATR-CCS, and NGD-CCS have scale factors of 0.67, 0.68, 0.54, and 0.65, respectively. The hydrogen cost variation with capacity shows that operating SMR-52% and ATR-CCS above hydrogen capacity of 200 tonnes/day is economically attractive. Blue hydrogen from autothermal reforming has the lowest life cycle GHG emissions of 3.91 kgCO2eq/kg H2, followed by blue hydrogen from NGD (4.54 kgCO2eq/kg H2), SMR-85% (6.66 kgCO2eq/kg H2), and SMR-52% (8.20 kgCO2eq/kg H2). The findings of this study are useful for decision-making at various levels.},

   volume = {2},
   abstract = {The combination of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) and water electrolysis technologies can be used for the production of basic chemicals from carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen. Here, we present a life cycle assessment (LCA) on a cradle-to-gate basis for the production of the following large volume organic chemicals: methanol, ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, and mixed xylenes. Investigated process chains comprise the following technologies: CO2 capture from an industrial point-source or from the atmosphere through direct air capture (DAC); alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production; methanol synthesis; methanol-to-olefins and methanol-to-aromatics synthesis including aromatics separation. Electricity is supplied by offshore wind turbines. The system boundary includes all relevant processes from cradle to gate. A scenario was set up by exchanging the background processes for the production of important infrastructure materials like aluminum, copper, steel, and concrete with future processes that are less resource intensive, less carbon intensive and include higher recycling rates (e.g., electric arc furnaces for steel production). LCA results show that the synthesis of the investigated chemicals from CCU processes will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 88–97%, compared to fossil-based production routes, when electricity from offshore wind turbines is used. At the same time, other environmental impacts like eutrophication and ozone depletion will increase. The main contributors to the environmental impacts are the energy supply for water electrolysis and direct air capture. Replacement of all plants for the production of the investigated products in Germany with CCU processes would lead to a 2–7% higher total primary energy demand for the whole country. At the same time, an overall reduction of the German GHG emissions by 6% is achieved, when using offshore wind power for these processes only. The future scenario using improved background technologies leads to a further small reduction of GHG emissions and largely reduces other environmental impacts. We therefore identify the reduction of emissions through improved base material production processes and recycling of aluminum, copper, steel and concrete as main objectives to reduce negative impacts for the production of basic chemicals from CCU technologies.

   abstract = {Ethanol is being projected as a renewable future biofuel to be a total substitute for gasoline by policymakers in India. Today it is used in blended form with gasoline. Ethanol in India is produced from sugarcane in distilleries and most of those are integrated with sugar industries. Anecdotal evidence suggests that sugarcane production in India consumes lot of water and for irrigating the crop electricity is consumed. Electricity is produced from fossil fuel mainly coal in India. Quantifying the energy input that goes into sugarcane production and ethanol processing is therefore relevant. This paper reports the findings from field investigations into the energy use practices of sugarcane production in a sugarcane belt of Maharashtra and a study of energy use in sugar industry. Net energy value is reported in MJ per litre of Ethanol and is found to be 40% surplus. Similar studies are reported for Brazilian Ethanol by investigators. The key differences in net energy value in India and Brazil arise from the assumptions regarding cane growing practices including power required in pumped irrigation and fertilizer application per litre of ethanol production. Net energy analysis of biofuels depends on the data assumed by the researchers regarding input of energy use, source of energy, energy value of co-products and land and water productivity of sugar cane. Sensitivity analysis is therefore included to account for all these parameters.},

   abstract = {Bioethanol is one of the most promising and eco-friendly alternatives to fossil fuels, which is produced from renewable sources. Although almost all the current fuel ethanol is generated from edible sources (sugars and starch), lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) has drawn much attention in recent times. However, the conversion efficiency as well as ethanol yield of the biomass differs greatly with respect to the source and nature of LCB, primarily due to the variation in lignocellulosic content. Two major polysaccharides in LCB, namely, cellulose and hemicellulose firmly link to lignin and form a complex lignocellulosic network, which is highly robust and recalcitrant to depolymerization. For this reason, generation of ethanol from LCB requires a complicated conversion process that has made it commercially non-competitive. As attempts to exploit LCBs into commercial ethanol production, recent research efforts have been devoted to the techno-economic improvements of the overall conversion process, in addition to screen out promising feedstocks. This review paper presents an overview on the diversity of biomass, technological approaches and microbial contribution to the conversion of LCB into ethanol.},

   volume = {56},
   pages = {193 - 202},
   abstract = {A comprehensive economic analysis of twenty light olefin production pathways has been performed, covering current and promising processes from fossil (petroleum, coal and natural gas) and renewable resources (biomass and CO2). Taking steam cracking of naphtha as the benchmark, this study gives an economic perspective and points out the bottleneck in different olefin production pathways. The assessment indicates that nearly all renewable pathways are economically unattractive currently and the raw material cost accounts for dominant contribution in most pathways, especially in the oil-, natural gas- and CO2-derived pathways. For the ways of methanol-to-olefins and methanol-to-propylene, fossil pathways are cost-competitive according to the date of current Chinese market prices. However, the price of feedstock hydrogen needs to be lowered by 55% to fill the cost gap between CO2-derived pathways and the benchmark. For the ways of oxidative coupling of methane and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to olefins, fossil pathways enable cost-competitive processes by feedstock price fall, but further process improvement is required to approach benchmark in renewable pathways. Conditionally, a decrease in ethanol price by 45% can make ethanol dehydration pathway profitable. In addition, costs can reduce by 4%–23% in different pathways as the production scales expand from 100 to 1000 kt/a, resulting in a change from high cost to economic profit for some of the pathways. The results quantify the need for improvements on feedstock price, scale size and process improvement to achieve competitive production costs.},
