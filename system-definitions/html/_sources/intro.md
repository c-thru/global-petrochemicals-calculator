C-THRU global petrochemicals calculator: system definitions
===========================================================

This document defines the "processes" and "objects" which constitute the model of chemical flows for the calculator.

The system definitions in the following sections define objects and processes which are the building blocks for the model. Where possible, we re-use the UK FIRES production system definitions {cite}`lupton_ukproductionsystem_2024`.  Since the full set of definitions from that work is not finally published yet, the relevant definitions are reproduced here with a prefix `ukf:`.

These definitions are generated automatically from the model code.
