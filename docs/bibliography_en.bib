   abstract = {Maize is the second most produced food commodity in the world. Brazil is the world’s third largest producer of maize, and the state of São Paulo is one of the major maize producers in Brazil. This study uses life cycle assessment to quantify and compare the environmental impacts to produce one ton of grain and sweet maize in the southwest of São Paulo state, from cradle-to-storage at seaport boundaries. The life cycle inventory was elaborated for the 2016–2017 harvest season. Environmental impacts were assessed using the CML 2015 impact assessment method. Three other methods were tested in sensitivity analysis. Results showed impacts of 203 kg CO2 eq. for global warming, 0.55 kg SO2 eq. for acidification, 0.53 kg PO4 eq. for eutrophication, 1197 MJ for abiotic depletion, and 962 kg DCB eq. for freshwater ecotoxicity, per ton of grain maize. A comparison of grain with sweet maize showed that the latter had lower environmental impacts if consumed at São Paulo megacity. Improvements are necessary for the systems and can be achieved by minimizing or substituting the most impactful flows (i.e., hotspots), which were fertilizers (for global warming and eutrophication), pesticides (for freshwater ecotoxicity), and transport activities (for abiotic depletion and acidification). Sensitivity analysis showed that a reduction of 20% in the transport process affected most the results. Transport activities can thus be an important opportunity to improve the environmental impacts of these systems and are also an incentive for producers to explore local market.},

This is related to their good properties (mechanical and thermal) which can also be modified by additives, other polymers (blends and multilayers) and fillers (composites). But these complex systems (several components) make the final materials more difficult to recycle. In this review, basic statistics on the production rate of polyamides are presented and the different recycling methods are reported to compare their advantages and limitations with respect to economics and technical analyses. The discussion includes biological, chemical, mechanical, physical, and thermal treatments to reintroduce, as much as possible, the parts after their end-of-service. Finally, a general conclusion on the current state of PA recycling is presented with several openings for future developments to satisfy the concept of circular economy and general sustainability.},

First, the processes of producing aromatics from methanol and naphtha are modeled in the Aspen HYSYS simulator to obtain detailed mass and energy balances. On this basis, the technoeconomic and life cycle analyses are conducted. The comparative results indicate that the net present value of producing aromatics from methanol is significantly higher than producing aromatics from naphtha. Moreover, the total capital investment of the former is lower than the latter. In terms of the ten studied impact categories, methanol derived from natural gas leads to the least freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity potential, while that derived from biomass shows the lowest abiotic depletion potential, global warming potential, ozone layer depletion potential, and photochemical ozone creation potential. However, naphtha does the best performance regarding the rest five impact categories.},

Therefore, catalytic depolymerization of PS represents the best alternative to overcome these economical drawbacks, since the presence of a catalyst can improve product selectivity for chemical recycling and upcycling of PS. This minireview focuses on the catalytic processes for the production of styrene and other valuable aromatics from PS waste, and it aims to lay the ground for PS recyclability and long-term sustainable PS production.},

Resource efficiency and circularity interventions reduce global chemicals demand by 23 to 33% and are critical for mitigating risks associated with using fossil feedstocks and carbon capture and sequestration, and constraints on available biogenic and recyclate feedstocks. Replacing fossil feedstocks with biogenic/air-capture sources, shifting carbon destinations from the atmosphere to ground, and electrifying/decarbonizing energy supply for production technologies could enable net negative emissions of 0.5 GtCO2eq y−1 across non-ammonia chemicals, while still delivering essential chemical-based services to society.},

Substantial research is focused on finding more sustainable building blocks for next-generation polymers. Meys et al. report a series of life cycle analyses suggesting that even the current varieties of commercial monomers could potentially be manufactured and polymerized with no net greenhouse gas emissions. The cycle relies on combining recycling of plastic waste with chemical reduction of carbon dioxide captured from incineration or derived from biomass. —JSY Recycling, biomass processing, and carbon dioxide chemical reduction could ultimately eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions of plastics. Mitigating life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of plastics is perceived as energy intensive and costly. We developed a bottom-up model that represents the life cycle of 90% of global plastics to examine pathways to net-zero emission plastics. Our results show that net-zero emission plastics can be achieved by combining biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) utilization with an effective recycling rate of 70% while saving 34 to 53% of energy. Operational costs for net-zero emission plastics are in the same range as those for linear fossil-based production with carbon capture and storage and could even be substantially reduced. Realizing the full cost-saving potential of 288 billion US dollars requires low-cost supply of biomass and CO2, high-cost supply of oil, and incentivizing large-scale recycling and lowering investment barriers for all technologies that use renewable carbon feedstock.},

In the second part, a techno-economic analysis of a bioethylene plant was performed using Aspen® plus and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer, where different qualities of ethanol were considered. The results show that impurities in the ethanol feed have no significant effect on the quality of the produced polymer-grade bioethylene.

   abstract = {Research into the production of biodegradable polymers has been driven by vision for the most part from changes in policy, in Europe and America. These policies have their origins in the Brundtland Report of 1987, which provides a platform for a more sustainable society. Biodegradable polymers are part of the emerging portfolio of renewable raw materials seeking to deliver environmental, social, and economic benefits. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are naturally-occurring biodegradable-polyesters accumulated by bacteria usually in response to inorganic nutrient limitation in the presence of excess carbon. Most of the early research into PHA accumulation and technology development for industrial-scale production was undertaken using virgin starting materials. For example, polyhydroxybutyrate and copolymers such as polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate are produced today at industrial scale from corn-derived glucose. However, in recent years, research has been undertaken to convert domestic and industrial wastes to PHA. These wastes in today’s context are residuals seen by a growing body of stakeholders as platform resources for a biobased society. In the present review, we consider residuals from food, plastic, forest and lignocellulosic, and biodiesel manufacturing (glycerol). Thus, this review seeks to gain perspective of opportunities from literature reporting the production of PHA from carbon-rich residuals as feedstocks. A discussion on approaches and context for PHA production with reference to pure- and mixed-culture technologies is provided. Literature reports advocate results of the promise of waste conversion to PHA. However, the vast majority of studies on waste to PHA is at laboratory scale. The questions of surmounting the technical and political hurdles to industrialization are generally left unanswered. There are a limited number of studies that have progressed into fermentors and a dearth of pilot-scale demonstration. A number of fermentation studies show that biomass and PHA productivity can be increased, and sometimes dramatically, in a fermentor. The relevant application-specific properties of the polymers from the wastes studied and the effect of altered-waste composition on polymer properties are generally not well reported and would greatly benefit the progress of the research as high productivity is of limited value without the context of requisite case-specific polymer properties. The proposed use of a waste residual is advantageous from a life cycle viewpoint as it removes the direct or indirect effect of PHA production on land usage and food production. However, the question, of how economic drivers will promote or hinder advancements to demonstration scale, when wastes generally become understood as resources for a biobased society, hangs today in the balance due to a lack of shared vision and the legacy of mistakes made with first generation bioproducts.},

   title = {Comparative assessment of blue hydrogen from steam methane reforming, autothermal reforming, and natural gas decomposition technologies for natural gas-producing regions},
   journal = {Energy Conversion and Management},
   volume = {254},
   pages = {115245},
   abstract = {Interest in blue hydrogen production technologies is growing. Some researchers have evaluated the environmental and/or economic feasibility of producing blue hydrogen, but a holistic assessment is still needed. Many aspects of hydrogen production have not been investigated. There is very limited information in the literature on the impact of plant size on production and the extent of carbon capture on the cost and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of blue hydrogen production through various production pathways. Detailed uncertainty and sensitivity analyses have not been included in most of the earlier studies. This study conducts a holistic comparative cost and life cycle GHG emissions’ footprint assessment of three natural gas-based blue hydrogen production technologies – steam methane reforming (SMR), autothermal reforming (ATR), and natural gas decomposition (NGD) to address these research gaps. A hydrogen production plant capacity of 607 tonnes per day was considered. For SMR, based on the percentage of carbon capture and capture points, we considered two scenarios, SMR-52% (indicates 52% carbon capture) and SMR-85% (indicates 85% carbon capture). A scale factor was developed for each technology to understand the hydrogen production cost with a change in production plant size. Hydrogen cost is 1.22, 1.23, 2.12, 1.69, 2.36, 1.66, and 2.55 $/kg H2 for SMR, ATR, NGD, SMR-52%, SMR-85%, ATR with carbon capture and sequestration (ATR-CCS), and NGD with carbon capture and sequestration (NGD-CCS), respectively. The results indicate that when uncertainty is considered, SMR-52% and ATR are economically preferable to NGD and SMR-85%. SMR-52% could outperform ATR-CCS when the natural gas price decreases and the rate of return increases. SMR-85% is the least attractive pathway; however, it could outperform NGD economically when CO2 transportation cost and natural gas price decrease. Hydrogen storage cost significantly impacts the hydrogen production cost. SMR-52%, SMR-85%, ATR-CCS, and NGD-CCS have scale factors of 0.67, 0.68, 0.54, and 0.65, respectively. The hydrogen cost variation with capacity shows that operating SMR-52% and ATR-CCS above hydrogen capacity of 200 tonnes/day is economically attractive. Blue hydrogen from autothermal reforming has the lowest life cycle GHG emissions of 3.91 kgCO2eq/kg H2, followed by blue hydrogen from NGD (4.54 kgCO2eq/kg H2), SMR-85% (6.66 kgCO2eq/kg H2), and SMR-52% (8.20 kgCO2eq/kg H2). The findings of this study are useful for decision-making at various levels.},

   volume = {2},
   abstract = {The combination of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) and water electrolysis technologies can be used for the production of basic chemicals from carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen. Here, we present a life cycle assessment (LCA) on a cradle-to-gate basis for the production of the following large volume organic chemicals: methanol, ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, and mixed xylenes. Investigated process chains comprise the following technologies: CO2 capture from an industrial point-source or from the atmosphere through direct air capture (DAC); alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production; methanol synthesis; methanol-to-olefins and methanol-to-aromatics synthesis including aromatics separation. Electricity is supplied by offshore wind turbines. The system boundary includes all relevant processes from cradle to gate. A scenario was set up by exchanging the background processes for the production of important infrastructure materials like aluminum, copper, steel, and concrete with future processes that are less resource intensive, less carbon intensive and include higher recycling rates (e.g., electric arc furnaces for steel production). LCA results show that the synthesis of the investigated chemicals from CCU processes will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 88–97%, compared to fossil-based production routes, when electricity from offshore wind turbines is used. At the same time, other environmental impacts like eutrophication and ozone depletion will increase. The main contributors to the environmental impacts are the energy supply for water electrolysis and direct air capture. Replacement of all plants for the production of the investigated products in Germany with CCU processes would lead to a 2–7% higher total primary energy demand for the whole country. At the same time, an overall reduction of the German GHG emissions by 6% is achieved, when using offshore wind power for these processes only. The future scenario using improved background technologies leads to a further small reduction of GHG emissions and largely reduces other environmental impacts. We therefore identify the reduction of emissions through improved base material production processes and recycling of aluminum, copper, steel and concrete as main objectives to reduce negative impacts for the production of basic chemicals from CCU technologies.

Indeed, the processing of polyurethane wastes can be significantly beneficial not only from an ecological but also from an economic point of view. At present, feedstock (namely, glycolysis) and mechanical recycling are the two most important strategies to recover and recycle polyurethanes; notwithstanding, “biological recycling”, an approach that exploits the biological degradation of the polymer, is gaining interest. This review aims to elucidate the recycling processes of both thermoplastic and thermosetting polyurethanes, providing the reader with some perspectives about their possible future developments.},

   volume = {229},
   pages = {57 - 68},
   abstract = {Ethanol production is expected to increase to 54 billion litres in 2030. Two alternatives from an agronomic point of view could be increasing the amount of area under sugarcane cultivation and/or narrowing the yield gaps. Precision agriculture (PA) approach and technologies for that are a feasible strategy to boost yields without the need for any further expansion of sugarcane areas. Through life cycle assessment (LCA), this study addressed the economic and environmental suitability of production expansion based on four scenarios in South-Central Brazil. Current production, expansion of area and yield, and PA technology adoption (fertiliser management and systematisation) are the scenarios assessed. The results showed that if no yield gain is achieved, an expansion of 4.5 million hectares of cultivated area will be required to reach those targets. To maintain stable cropping areas, the average yield of sugarcane should be increased from 76.2 Mg ha−1 to 122.4 Mg ha−1 in 2030. Such an increase could potentially reduce production costs by 26% and greenhouse gas emissions by 14% compared to those in the current scenario. However, the findings suggest that the adoption of site-specific management alone is not enough to address the necessary production to reach the goals by 2030. So, conclusions drawn from this study suggest that it will be necessary adopting strategies to increase sugarcane production, either through site-specific management or the expansion of cultivated area. The improved management of spatial–temporal variability through PA technologies is a win–win strategy to promote yield gains, reduce production costs and further ensure environmental benefits of sugarcane-based ethanol.},

Four major reasons explain the increasing interest in this field: pressure from citizens, stricter legal requirements, new and better technologies, and improved business cases. Rightfully, the public is dissatisfied with recycling rates, notably below 9% in the United States (1). This makes governments respond by enforcing a minimum recycled plastic content, such as the 30% target in the European Union. Therefore, a plastics circular economy, in which new, high-quality plastics can be remanufactured from plastic waste, is becoming increasingly popular. Plastics should no longer be considered waste but rather valuable resources. On pages 660 and 666 of this issue, Li et al. (2) and Xu et al.

In the recent years, with the depletion of petroleum resources, the coal chemical industry is gradually emerging. There is an increased demand of aromatics worldwide, and the aromatization technology of coal-based methanol can provide prosperous application for coal and relieve the stress of the shortage of aromatics resource. In this chapter, first, we analyze the economics of coal-based methanol to aromatics, and conclude that the coal-based methanol to aromatics process is more competitive in the market. Second, from the perspective of catalyst preparation, we discuss the effects of modification of different metals, different methods of metal modification, introduction of catalytic promoters, and diffusion properties on the selectivity and conversion of methanol to aromatics. Third, we elaborate the effects of reaction conditions and process parameters, and amplification effects on the industrial production of MTA. Fourth, we summarize the representative methanol aromatization technologies, and analyze the characteristics and advancement of each technology briefly, and put forward suggestions for industrial development. At last, we conducted a brief analysis and outlook on the future development trend of MTA technology.},

   abstract = {Due to the increasing environmental impact of food production, carbon footprint as an indicator can guide farmland management. This study established a method and estimated the carbon footprint of grain production in China based on life cycle analysis (LCA). The results showed that grain production has a high carbon footprint in 2013, i.e., 4052 kg ce/ha or 0.48 kg ce/kg for maize, 5455 kg ce/ha or 0.75 kg ce/kg for wheat and 11881 kg ce/ha or 1.60 kg ce/kg for rice. These footprints are higher than that of other countries, such as the United States, Canada and India. The most important factors governing carbon emissions were the application of nitrogen fertiliser (8–49%), straw burning (0–70%), energy consumption by machinery (6–40%), energy consumption for irrigation (0–44%) and CH4 emissions from rice paddies (15–73%). The most important carbon sequestration factors included returning of crop straw (41–90%), chemical nitrogen fertiliser application (10–59%) and no-till farming practices (0–10%). Different factors dominated in different crop systems in different regions. To identity site-specific key factors and take countermeasures could significantly lower carbon footprint, e.g., ban straw burning in northeast and south China, stopping continuous flooding irrigation in wheat and rice production system.},

   title = {An economic analysis of twenty light olefin production pathways},
   journal = {Journal of Energy Chemistry},
   volume = {56},
   pages = {193 - 202},
   abstract = {A comprehensive economic analysis of twenty light olefin production pathways has been performed, covering current and promising processes from fossil (petroleum, coal and natural gas) and renewable resources (biomass and CO2). Taking steam cracking of naphtha as the benchmark, this study gives an economic perspective and points out the bottleneck in different olefin production pathways. The assessment indicates that nearly all renewable pathways are economically unattractive currently and the raw material cost accounts for dominant contribution in most pathways, especially in the oil-, natural gas- and CO2-derived pathways. For the ways of methanol-to-olefins and methanol-to-propylene, fossil pathways are cost-competitive according to the date of current Chinese market prices. However, the price of feedstock hydrogen needs to be lowered by 55% to fill the cost gap between CO2-derived pathways and the benchmark. For the ways of oxidative coupling of methane and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to olefins, fossil pathways enable cost-competitive processes by feedstock price fall, but further process improvement is required to approach benchmark in renewable pathways. Conditionally, a decrease in ethanol price by 45% can make ethanol dehydration pathway profitable. In addition, costs can reduce by 4%–23% in different pathways as the production scales expand from 100 to 1000 kt/a, resulting in a change from high cost to economic profit for some of the pathways. The results quantify the need for improvements on feedstock price, scale size and process improvement to achieve competitive production costs.},
