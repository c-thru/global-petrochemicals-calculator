   abstract = {Abstract Polyamides (PA) are a family of engineering thermoplastics used in a wide range of applications including automotive, building, construction, separation processes, textiles, and so forth. This is related to their good properties (mechanical and thermal) which can also be modified by additives, other polymers (blends and multilayers) and fillers (composites). But these complex systems (several components) make the final materials more difficult to recycle. In this review, basic statistics on the production rate of polyamides are presented and the different recycling methods are reported to compare their advantages and limitations with respect to economics and technical analyses. The discussion includes biological, chemical, mechanical, physical, and thermal treatments to reintroduce, as much as possible, the parts after their end-of-service. Finally, a general conclusion on the current state of PA recycling is presented with several openings for future developments to satisfy the concept of circular economy and general sustainability.},

   abstract = {Polystyrene (PS) is one of the most popular plastics due to its versatility, which renders it useful for a large variety of applications, including laboratory equipment, insulation and food packaging. However, its recycling is still a challenge, as both mechanical and chemical (thermal) recycling strategies are often cost-prohibitive in comparison to current disposal methods. Therefore, catalytic depolymerization of PS represents the best alternative to overcome these economical drawbacks, since the presence of a catalyst can improve product selectivity for chemical recycling and upcycling of PS. This minireview focuses on the catalytic processes for the production of styrene and other valuable aromatics from PS waste, and it aims to lay the ground for PS recyclability and long-term sustainable PS production.},

Within the circular economy concept and also considering the current need for limiting the environmental impact of plastics, several methods have been designed, assessed, and exploited for the recovery at the end-of-life of polyurethanes and for their recycling. Indeed, the processing of polyurethane wastes can be significantly beneficial not only from an ecological but also from an economic point of view. At present, feedstock (namely, glycolysis) and mechanical recycling are the two most important strategies to recover and recycle polyurethanes; notwithstanding, “biological recycling”, an approach that exploits the biological degradation of the polymer, is gaining interest. This review aims to elucidate the recycling processes of both thermoplastic and thermosetting polyurethanes, providing the reader with some perspectives about their possible future developments.},

   abstract = {Production of detergents and aldehydes could help tackle plastic pollution Not a week passes without a chemical company announcing that it will be investing in a new recycling facility. Four major reasons explain the increasing interest in this field: pressure from citizens, stricter legal requirements, new and better technologies, and improved business cases. Rightfully, the public is dissatisfied with recycling rates, notably below 9% in the United States (1). This makes governments respond by enforcing a minimum recycled plastic content, such as the 30% target in the European Union. Therefore, a plastics circular economy, in which new, high-quality plastics can be remanufactured from plastic waste, is becoming increasingly popular. Plastics should no longer be considered waste but rather valuable resources. On pages 660 and 666 of this issue, Li et al. (2) and Xu et al. (3), respectively, report strategies to recycle plastic waste into potentially valuable products, such as alcohols, aldehydes, surfactants, and detergents.},
