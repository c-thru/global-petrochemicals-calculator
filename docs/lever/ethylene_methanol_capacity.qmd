```{python}
#| output: false

```

```{python}
describe_lever_levels("ethylene_methanol_capacity")
```

This lever controls the available capacity of MTO (Methanol-to-Olefins), measured by the ethylene production capacity.

Currently, this is a route with small capacity, and the *Baseline* level assumes this remains constant.

The reference projection is based on the trend from @methanol_mmsa_2023.

Since this is currently a route with limited capacity, further hypothetical levels were added reflecting greater growth rates, to allow exploration of what would happen if this route made a larger contribution in future.

## Parameter data
