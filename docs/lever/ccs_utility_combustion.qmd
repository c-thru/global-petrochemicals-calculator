# ccs_utility_combustion

```{python}
#| output: false
from plot_levers import plot_lever, describe_lever_levels, param_units
```

```{python}
describe_lever_levels("ccs_utility_combustion")
```

This lever controls the level of emissions abatement on utility combustion emissions.

Currently practically no Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is in use, so the baseline level has no capacity applied.

To allow exploring different levels of CCS applied to combustion emissions specifically, hypothetical higher levels are included.

## Parameter data

```{python}
#| layout-ncol: 2
plot_lever("ccs_utility_combustion", param_descriptions={})
```
