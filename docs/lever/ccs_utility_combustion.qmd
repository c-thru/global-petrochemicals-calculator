# ccs_utility_combustion

```{python}
#| output: false
from plot_levers import plot_lever, describe_lever_levels, param_units
```

```{python}
describe_lever_levels("ccs_utility_combustion")
```

This lever controls the level of emissions abatement on utility combustion emissions.

Currently practically no CCS is in use [meng_planet_2023], so the baseline level has no capacity applied.

To allow exploring different levels of CCS applied to combustion emissions specifically, hypothetical higher levels are included.

## Parameter data

```{python}
#| layout-ncol: 2
plot_lever("ccs_utility_combustion", param_descriptions={})
```
