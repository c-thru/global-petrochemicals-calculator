# blue_hydrogen_capacity

```{python}
#| output: false
from plot_levers import plot_lever, describe_lever_levels, param_units
```

```{python}
describe_lever_levels("blue_hydrogen_capacity")
```

This lever controls production capacity for "blue" hydrogen, i.e. from steam methane reforming of natural gas, with CCS (carbon capture and storage).

The values were derived as described in @sec-green-hydrogen-capacity.

## Parameter data

```{python}
#| layout-ncol: 2
plot_lever("blue_hydrogen_capacity", param_descriptions={})
```
